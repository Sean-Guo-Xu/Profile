                        I developed a strong interest in bioinformatics in high school, which deepened during my university years.
                        Through various research projects,  I have acquired the ability to apply bioinformatics for analysis, computation, visualization, and solving various scientific problems. 
                        My focus now extends beyond bioinformatics to the underlying principles of statistics and data science, with a focus on developing algorithms and integrating them into data analysis workflows.
                        In other words, I aim to incorporate new elements into large-scale bioinformatics analyses to produce higher-impact publications. 
                        To achieve this goal, I remain committed to learning mathematics and data science, continuously enhancing my ability to apply them to solve biological problems. 
                        If your research aligns with my goals, I would be honored to discuss potential collaborations, whether your focus is in neuroscience, medicine, microbiology, or other fields.

                <h4>Research Assistant</h4>
                <p>
                    In the year following my graduation, at the invitation of Professor Han, I was hired as a research assistant in the laboratory, assisting the research team with multiple bioinformatics analyses related to abdominal aortic aneurysms. 
                    Based on single-cell sequencing data, we conducted three sub-projects in different directions, utilizing GWAS-eQTL colocalization, Mendelian randomization, and cross-species, cross-tissue, or cross-disease state single-cell data analyses (see <a href="#AAA"><b>Research on Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)</b></a>). 
                    Additionally, I developed a new functional enrichment scoring algorithm for single-cell data, centered around probability, offering several advantages. Lastly, a new research project on AAA and ethnicity is currently in preparation.

                <h4>Members: Huawei Zhu, Yuejie Fang, Yanbo Xu and Jun Xia</h4>
                <p>As the initiator, I organized an "undergraduate research group" composed solely of undergraduate students, and without any professor's guidance, we completed<a href="#AML"><b> a bioinformatics study related to acute myeloid leukemia</b></a>.
                    Using public data, we constructed an epigenetic network to explore prognosis and treatment options. During the integrated multi-omics analysis, we applied various bioinformatics and statistical methods. 
                    Although  organizIed the project and proposed the research concept, due to the institution's policy prohibiting students from being listed as corresponding authors, I decided to share the first authorship with other members, with Professor Yubo Liu as the corresponding author.

                    I participated in the Youth Excellence Program at the Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and under the guidance of Professor Wu, I was involved in Project <a href="#fungalmetabolite"><b>Cluster analysis of fungal biosynthetic gene clusters and exploration of metabolic biosynthesis diversity</b></a>, which aimed to predict the biodiversity potential of the entire fungal kingdom using a series of bioinformatics and statistical methods. 
                    Since the start of the project in the summer of 2022, I have been responsible for bioinformatics analysis, including data processing, statistical analysis, software programming and application, and visualization. 
                    During this time, I collaborated with a graduate student, Zhang Shu (from the collab research group) to complete the core aspects of the research, and my research results from this project were incorporated into my graduation thesis.

                    During this time, I studied biostatistics, population genetics, and biological evolution by attending various courses and lectures. 
                    With the guidance of Prof. Wu and other members of the research group, I became familiar with working in a Linux server environment and gained hands-on experience analyzing high-throughput microbial microsatellite data. 
                    This knowledge and experience provided a solid foundation for me to independently undertake scientific research projects.
